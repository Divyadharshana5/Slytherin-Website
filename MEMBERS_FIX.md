# Members Section - Issue Fixed! ✅

## Problem Identified

The members' images and details were not displaying because the image paths were set to `"/.jpg"` (empty/missing filenames).

## Solution Applied

I've updated all member image paths to use **existing images** from your `public` folder:

### Updated Members List:

## Next Steps (Optional):

### To Add Real Member Photos:

1. Place member photos in the `public` folder with these names:

   - For Allwyn: name the file as per your preference (e.g., `allwyn.jpg`)
   - For Dilli Basker: `dilli.jpg`
   - For Premavathy: `prema.jpg`
   - etc.

2. Update the image paths in `src/components/Teams/Teams.jsx` in the `members` array

3. Update the social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Portfolio) with real URLs

### To Customize:

- Edit member names in the `members` array
- Change positions/titles
- Update GitHub/LinkedIn/Portfolio URLs
- Adjust styling in `Teams.css`

## How to View:

Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/**
Then scroll to the bottom of the Teams page to see the Members section!
